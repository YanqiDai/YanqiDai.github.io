# About me
------

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Zhiwu Lu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/luzhiwu). I am currently a visiting student at the College of Computing and Data Science, Nanyang Technological University, under the supervision of Prof. [Hanwang Zhang](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/).
Before my doctoral studies, I received my B.E. from the School of Software at Dalian University of Technology.

My research interests focus on **large multimodal models**, **role-playing agents**, **RL reasoning**, and **multi-task learning**.
