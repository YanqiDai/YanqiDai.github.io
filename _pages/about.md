# About me
------

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in the Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence at Renmin University of China, supervised by Prof. [Zhiwu Lu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/luzhiwu). 
I am currently a visiting student in the College of Computing and Data Science at Nanyang Technological University, advised by Prof. [Luu Anh Tuan](https://tuanluu.github.io) and Prof. [Hanwang Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=YG0DFyYAAAAJ).
Before my doctoral studies, I received my B.E. from the School of Software at Dalian University of Technology.

My research interests lie in **large multimodal models, RL for reasoning, and multi-task learning**.
Through my research, I aim to develop more powerful and versatile large multimodal models.
