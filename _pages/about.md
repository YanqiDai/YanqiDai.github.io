# About me
------

I am a third-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Zhiwu Lu](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/english/luzhiwu) fortunately. Before that, I received my B.E. from the [School of Software](https://ss.dlut.edu.cn/), [Dalian University of Technology](https://www.dlut.edu.cn/).

My research interests include **large multimodal models**, **multimodal role-playing agents**, and **multi-task learning**.
Through my research, I aim to enhance the multi-task capabilities of large multimodal models and apply multimodal role-playing in mental health.

My CV is here: [Yanqi Dai's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/YanqiDai_Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
